# Model Assets

This directory is packaged with the Android application. Place the `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-Q4_0.gguf` weights file in this
folder so the native llama runtime can load it at runtime. The repository ships with a small placeholder file to keep the folder in
version control. Replace the placeholder with the actual GGUF weights before shipping the app.
