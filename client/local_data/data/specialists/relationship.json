      "content": "The Four Horsemen predict divorce with 94% accuracy: Criticism (attacking character), Contempt (superiority/disrespect), Defensiveness (victim mentality), Stonewalling (emotional withdrawal). Case Study: Couple therapy with Mark and Susan - eliminated contemptuous communication in 8 sessions, relationship satisfaction increased from 3/10 to 8/10. Antidotes protocol: Replace criticism with complaints using 'I' statements, build culture of appreciation to counter contempt, take responsibility instead of defensiveness, self-soothe during stonewalling. Love Map exercise: 60 questions about partner's inner world, dreams, fears, hopes. Daily connection rituals: 6-minute daily check-in (2 min each partner, 2 min appreciation). Repair attempts: humor, affection, taking responsibility, stopping action. Success rate: Gottman Method Couples Therapy shows 85% improvement in relationship satisfaction.",

Three stages: Stage 1 (4-8 sessions) - identify negative cycles, access underlying emotions; Stage 2 (4-8 sessions) - restructure interactions, create bonding events; Stage 3 (2-4 sessions) - consolidate changes, plan maintenance. Case Study: David and Lisa, married 12 years, stuck in pursue-withdraw cycle - Stage 1 identified Lisa's fear of abandonment driving pursuit, David's fear of inadequacy causing withdrawal. Stage 2 breakthrough: David expressed vulnerability about feeling criticized, Lisa responded with empathy instead of pursuit. Attachment styles impact: Secure-secure couples (easiest treatment), anxious-avoidant (most common challenging pattern), disorganized attachment requires trauma processing first. Bonding events exercises: Structured vulnerability conversations, physical comfort practices, appreciation rituals.",
