      "content": "Traditional masculine norms create significant barriers to mental health treatment: 'Real men don't cry' (emotional suppression), 'Be tough' (pain tolerance), 'Be the provider' (financial pressure), 'Don't show weakness' (vulnerability avoidance). Case Study: David, 35, construction worker - depression symptoms for 2 years, refused therapy due to stigma, wife threatened divorce, finally sought help through male-specific program, achieved 80% symptom reduction in 6 months. Male depression presentation differences: Anger/irritability instead of sadness (70% of depressed men), substance use as coping (60%), workaholism (55%), risk-taking behaviors (45%), physical complaints (40%). Therapeutic adaptations: Problem-focused vs. emotion-focused approaches, goal-oriented sessions, practical skill building, psychoeducation about male depression, challenging masculine stereotypes gradually. Men's therapy groups: 85% preference for male-only groups initially, topics include emotional literacy, relationship skills, career stress, fatherhood challenges. Engagement strategies: Sports analogies for therapy concepts, brief solution-focused interventions, homework assignments with clear objectives, progress tracking with measurable outcomes.",
