Visual - light sensitivity, visual overwhelm, difficulty with visual attention. Vestibular (movement/balance) - seeking or avoiding movement, balance difficulties. Proprioceptive (body awareness) - difficulty judging force, need for heavy work activities. Interventions: Sensory diet - scheduled sensory activities throughout day, environmental modifications, sensory tools (fidgets, weighted blankets, noise-canceling headphones). Occupational therapy: Sensory integration therapy, motor skills development, self-regulation strategies, adaptive strategies for daily activities.

Strengths-based approach celebrating special interests, accommodating sensory needs, teaching self-advocacy resulted in improved self-esteem and academic performance. Principles of neurodiversity-affirming practice: Presume competence, respect for autonomy and self-determination, accommodation rather than normalization, identity-first language when preferred by individual, involving neurodivergent voices in decisions. Strengths-based approaches: Identify and build upon individual strengths and interests, use special interests as motivation and learning tools, develop self-advocacy skills, promote self-understanding and acceptance. Environmental modifications: Sensory-friendly environments, flexible communication methods, alternative assessment options, reduced stigma and bias, inclusive practices. Self-advocacy development: Understanding of own needs and rights, communication skills for requesting accommodations, self-determination skills, connecting with neurodivergent community, leadership opportunities.
