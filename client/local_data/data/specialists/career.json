Maslach Burnout Inventory dimensions: Emotional exhaustion (feeling drained), depersonalization (cynical attitudes), reduced personal accomplishment (inefficacy feelings). Case Study: Sarah, nurse manager - MBI scores: EE 54 (severe), DP 30 (severe), PA 12 (low). 6-month intervention reduced EE to 22, DP to 8, PA to 39. Recovery protocol: Phase 1 (months 1-2) reduce workload 25%, increase sleep to 8+ hours, implement stress management. Phase 2 (months 3-4) job crafting exercises, strength identification, social support building. Phase 3 (months 5-6) meaning-making activities, career goal alignment, workplace boundary setting. Early warning signs: Sunday scaries, chronic fatigue, cynicism, decreased performance, physical symptoms (headaches, insomnia).
