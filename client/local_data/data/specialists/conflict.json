Case Study: Department heads in conflict over budget allocation - 4-hour mediation session resulted in collaborative budget plan, improved working relationship scores from 2/10 to 8/10. Mediation process: 1) Opening statements (mediator explains process, parties state positions), 2) Information gathering (explore underlying interests and needs), 3) Option generation (brainstorm solutions collaboratively), 4) Negotiation (evaluate options, make trade-offs), 5) Agreement drafting (specific, measurable terms). Mediator skills: Active listening, reframing negative language, managing emotions, maintaining neutrality, asking powerful questions. When to mediate: Communication breakdown, personality conflicts, resource disputes, policy disagreements, team dysfunction. Not suitable for: Harassment/discrimination, violence threats, significant power imbalances, legal violations.",

Resolution success depends on willingness to understand other perspective and find mutual solutions. Case Study: Roommate conflict over cleanliness standards - structured conversation process identified different upbringing values, created specific cleaning schedule and responsibility chart, reduced tension by 90%. Conflict styles assessment: Competing (win-lose), Accommodating (lose-win), Avoiding (lose-lose), Compromising (partial win-win), Collaborating (win-win). Optimal style varies by situation importance and relationship value. Communication repair steps: 1) Take responsibility for your part, 2) Express understanding of other's perspective, 3) Share your feelings without blame, 4) Request specific behavioral changes, 5) Agree on future prevention strategies. De-escalation techniques: Lower voice tone, use 'I' statements, acknowledge emotions, take breaks when heated, focus on specific behaviors not character attacks.",

Family systems perspective: Individual behavior influenced by family patterns, triangulation (involving third party to manage conflict), differentiation (maintaining self while staying connected), emotional cutoff (extreme distancing). Intergenerational patterns: Communication styles passed down, trauma responses inherited, value conflicts between generations, role expectations and changes. Intervention strategies: Family meetings with structured agendas, genogram analysis to understand patterns, boundary setting exercises, communication skills training, professional facilitation when needed. Cultural considerations: Collectivist vs. individualist values, authority structures, conflict expression norms, face-saving importance.",

Communication adaptations: High-context cultures prefer implicit messages, relationship building before task focus, face-saving considerations. Low-context cultures favor explicit communication, task orientation, direct feedback. Mediation adjustments: Cultural bridge-builders as co-mediators, extended relationship building time, face-saving solution options, family/community involvement considerations.

Case Study: Salary negotiation using principled approach - employee researched market rates (objective criteria), identified mutual interests (retention, performance), generated creative package including flexibility and development opportunities, achieved 12% increase plus benefits worth additional 8%. Preparation phase: Research other party's interests and constraints, identify your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement), determine reservation point (walk-away), prepare multiple options. During negotiation: Ask open-ended questions to understand interests, brainstorm options before evaluating, use 'yes, and...' instead of 'yes, but...', focus on creating value before claiming value. Common mistakes: Making first offer too low/high, focusing only on price, assuming fixed pie, getting emotionally reactive, poor preparation. Advanced techniques: Anchoring effectively, managing emotions (yours and theirs), dealing with difficult tactics, multi-issue negotiations, team negotiations.",

Digital communication challenges: Lack of tone and body language, delayed responses creating anxiety, forwarding/screenshot risks, permanent record concerns. Best practices: Use video for important discussions, clarify intent and tone explicitly, pause before responding when emotional, pick up phone for complex issues. Virtual mediation adaptations: Technology comfort assessment, backup communication methods, private breakout room capabilities, screen sharing for document review, recorded agreements when appropriate.
