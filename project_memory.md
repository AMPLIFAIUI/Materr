# Project Memory for Old-Mate

## Core Features

1. **Chat Functionality**
   - Allows users to interact with specialists.
   - Crisis detection integrated.

2. **Specialist Selection**
   - Users can choose specialists based on their needs.
   - Specialists data dynamically loaded from JSON files.

3. **Crisis Services**
   - Provides emergency contact information.
   - Crisis detection triggers alerts and escalations.

4. **Mobile App**
   - Android-specific files for building the app.
   - Gradle configuration for builds.

## Additional Features

1. **AI/ML Integration**
   - `llama_service.py` suggests AI/ML capabilities.

2. **Placeholder Data**
   - `local_data/` contains empty JSON files for future features like user data and conversations.

## Observations

- Duplicate or redundant files (e.g., `crisis_services.json` in multiple locations).
- Empty files in `local_data/` suggest planned but unimplemented features.

## Next Steps

1. Analyze all files in `src/` and `server/` for core functionality.
2. Consolidate and deduplicate JSON files.
3. Document implemented and planned features.
4. Ensure all features are functional and consistent.
