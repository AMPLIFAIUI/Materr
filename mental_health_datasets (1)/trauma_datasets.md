**Abstract:** This systematic review appraises the types, settings, scope, and delivery of trauma-informed interventions and their associated outcomes. The review found inconsistent evidence to support trauma-informed interventions as an effective approach for psychological outcomes. While many studies focused on reducing symptoms of PTSD, depression, or anxiety, and commonly used interventions like eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the overall evidence for their effectiveness was inconsistent. The study suggests that future trauma-informed interventions should expand in scope to address a wider range of trauma types (e.g., racism, discrimination) and outcomes.

**Key Findings:**
*   Evidence for the effectiveness of trauma-informed interventions for psychological outcomes is inconsistent.
*   Common interventions include EMDR and CBT, primarily targeting PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms.
*   There is a need to broaden the scope of trauma-informed interventions to include diverse trauma types and outcomes.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is crucial for the ‘Trauma’ domain. It provides a PhD-level overview of the current state of trauma-informed interventions, highlighting both promising approaches and areas needing further research. For the HelpMe app, this information can guide the development of content on trauma-informed care, ensuring that the app’s strategies are aligned with current research. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing various forms of trauma, including systemic and chronic adversity, and the need for a comprehensive approach to trauma recovery. The insights into the effectiveness of different interventions can help in curating relevant resources and tools within the app.
