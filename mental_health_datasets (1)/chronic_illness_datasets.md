**Abstract:** This study examined the impact of a mental health service on the management of chronic diseases in patients with co-occurring mental health conditions and chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). The findings showed significant improvements in mental health outcomes (PHQ-9 scores) and some chronic disease parameters (systolic and diastolic BP, LDL-C in specific subgroups) after enrollment in the mental health service. The study highlights the strong link between mental and physical health and the importance of integrated care in primary settings.

**Key Findings:**
*   Integrated mental health services can improve both mental health and chronic disease management outcomes.
*   There is a strong comorbidity between mental illness and chronic physical conditions.
*   Primary care settings are crucial for providing integrated care.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This research is highly relevant to the ‘Chronic Illness / Health Psychology’ domain. It provides PhD-level evidence for the interconnectedness of mental and physical health, particularly in the context of chronic illness. For the HelpMe app, this information can inform modules that address the psychological impact of chronic diseases, promote coping strategies, and emphasize the importance of holistic health management. It can also guide the app in providing resources that encourage users to seek integrated care and manage their mental well-being alongside their physical health conditions. The study’s focus on measurable outcomes can also inspire features within the app to track progress in both mental and physical health parameters.
