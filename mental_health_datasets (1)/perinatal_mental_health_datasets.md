**Abstract:** This systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluates the effectiveness of psychological interventions for perinatal depression (during pregnancy and up to 12 months postpartum). It found that psychological interventions, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in perinatal women, both in the short and long term. The review highlights the high prevalence and serious consequences of perinatal depression and the preference of women for psychological over pharmacological interventions. It also points out the need for higher quality studies and further research into other types of psychological interventions.

**Key Findings:**
*   Psychological interventions, especially CBT, are effective in treating perinatal depression.
*   Perinatal depression is a significant public health concern with serious impacts on mothers, infants, and families.
*   Women often prefer psychological interventions over pharmacological ones.
*   More high-quality research is needed on various psychological interventions for perinatal mental health.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is highly relevant to the ‘Perinatal Mental Health’ domain. It provides PhD-level evidence on effective psychological interventions for perinatal depression, which is a critical area for your app. The findings can inform the development of modules that offer evidence-based strategies for managing perinatal depression, focusing on CBT-based approaches. It also underscores the importance of addressing the unique challenges faced by women during pregnancy and postpartum, and the need for accessible, preferred interventions. The app can leverage this research to provide supportive content, self-help tools, and resources for women experiencing perinatal mental health issues, contributing to better maternal and infant outcomes.
