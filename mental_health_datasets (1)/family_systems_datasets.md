**Abstract:** This qualitative systematic review synthesizes family members' perspectives on helpful and unhelpful factors in family therapy (FT) sessions. It identifies four themes: therapist qualities contributing to the therapeutic alliance, practitioners' use of therapeutic techniques, intervention delivery, and family engagement with the process. Helpful factors included therapist warmth, sensitive connection, effective use of techniques, collaborative sessions, focus on strengths, and tailoring format to needs. Unhelpful factors included premature sharing, therapist siding, mismatched process, and insufficient early progress. The review aims to benefit FT application and training.

**Key Findings:**
*   Therapist qualities (warmth, sensitivity, non-judgment) are crucial for a strong therapeutic alliance.
*   Effective therapeutic techniques facilitate self-reflection, emotional expression, communication, and perspective-taking.
*   Collaborative and tailored intervention delivery enhances family engagement.
*   Early progress and a good match between therapy process and family needs are important for positive outcomes.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is highly relevant to the ‘Family Systems’ domain. It provides PhD-level insights into the client experience of family therapy, which is crucial for designing effective interventions within the app. Understanding what clients find helpful and unhelpful can inform the app's approach to guiding users through family-related mental health challenges. It emphasizes the importance of a supportive and collaborative approach, and the need for flexible strategies that can be tailored to individual family needs. This research can help the app develop content that promotes healthy family dynamics and provides practical tools for improving communication and resolving conflicts within a family system.
