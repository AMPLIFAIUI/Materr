**Abstract:** This study examines how support and strain from various relationship types (spouse/partner, children, mother, and friends/relatives) influence trajectories of depressive symptoms across different age groups. Using nationally representative panel data, the study found that support from a spouse was consistently related to fewer depressive symptoms across all age groups. Friendships were important for younger and older adults, while family relationships influenced depressive symptoms in midlife. The findings emphasize the importance of both support and strain in multiple types of relationships for mental health across the life course.

**Key Findings:**
*   Social relationships significantly impact mental health, particularly depressive symptoms.
*   Both support and strain within relationships play a crucial role.
*   The impact of different relationship types (e.g., spouse, friends, family) on mental health varies across the life course.
*   Spousal support is consistently linked to fewer depressive symptoms.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This research is highly relevant to the 'Relationships' domain. It provides a nuanced understanding of how different types of relationships and their quality (support vs. strain) affect mental health. This information can be used to develop modules within the HelpMe app that help users assess their relationship dynamics, identify sources of support and strain, and provide strategies for fostering healthy relationships to improve mental well-being. The life-course perspective is also valuable for tailoring advice to users of different ages.
