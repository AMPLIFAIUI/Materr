**Abstract:** This mixed-method systematic review evaluates mental health practitioners' attitudes towards and knowledge of LGBTQ+ patients and the impact of these factors on service utilization. It found that while practitioners generally hold affirming attitudes, there are significant gaps in their knowledge and skills regarding LGBTQ+ specific needs. These deficiencies can lead to decreased service seeking and unmet mental healthcare needs among LGBTQ+ patients. The review underscores the need for enhanced training and cultural competence at organizational and educational levels to improve care and reduce disparities.

**Key Findings:**
*   Mental health practitioners generally have positive attitudes towards LGBTQ+ patients.
*   Significant gaps exist in practitioners' clinical and cultural knowledge regarding LGBTQ+ issues.
*   These knowledge gaps contribute to unmet mental healthcare needs and reduced service utilization by LGBTQ+ individuals.
*   There is a strong need for enhanced training and education for mental health professionals on LGBTQ+ mental health.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is highly relevant to the ‘LGBTQ+ Mental Health’ domain. It provides PhD-level insights into the barriers LGBTQ+ individuals face in accessing mental healthcare, particularly related to practitioner knowledge and attitudes. For the HelpMe app, this information can inform the development of content that addresses these disparities, such as providing culturally competent resources, information on finding affirming care, and strategies for navigating healthcare systems. It also highlights the importance of creating a safe and inclusive environment within the app itself, ensuring that LGBTQ+ users feel understood and supported. The findings can help the app tailor its approach to address the unique stressors and needs of this population, promoting better mental health outcomes.
