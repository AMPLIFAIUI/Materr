**Abstract:** This systematic review assesses the quality of current clinical recommendation management guidelines for concurrent disorders (co-occurring substance use disorders and mental disorders). The review found that most guidelines had acceptable standards, but only the NICE guidelines provided detailed information across all AGREE II Domains. Guidelines generally supported combinations of treatments for individual disorders with a very small evidence base for concurrent disorders, and they provided little recommendation for further structuring of the field, such as level of complexity or staging, or evaluating different models of treatment integration. The study highlights that concurrent disorders are often underdiagnosed, undertreated, and more complex to manage, with significant gaps between the need for treatment and delivered services.

**Key Findings:**
*   Concurrent disorders are complex and often undertreated.
*   Existing guidelines for concurrent disorders have varying quality, with a need for more detailed and comprehensive recommendations.
*   There is a significant gap in evidence-based treatment integration models for concurrent disorders.
*   The review emphasizes the need for improved diagnosis and integrated treatment approaches for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is highly relevant to the 'Addiction' domain, particularly concerning co-occurring mental health disorders. It underscores the complexity of treating concurrent disorders and the need for integrated approaches. For the HelpMe app, this information can guide the development of modules that address the interconnectedness of addiction and other mental health conditions, emphasizing comprehensive and integrated care. It also highlights the importance of using high-quality, evidence-based guidelines and the need for continuous research in this area.
