**Summary:** This page lists various ongoing and completed clinical trials related to depression at UC San Diego. These trials cover a wide range of topics, including chronobiological basis of menopausal depression, neuromodulation and cognitive training for post-mTBI depression, transcranial magnetic stimulation, compassion meditation for veterans, cortical inhibition as a biomarker for treatment-resistant depression, dose-optimized transcranial direct current stimulation, enhancing transdiagnostic mechanisms of cognitive dyscontrol, individualized neuromodulation for anhedonic depression, maintenance rTMS, meditative neurofeedback, mindfulness engaged neurostimulation, and studies on pramipexole for social connections in anxiety/depression.

**Key Findings/Focus Areas:**
*   Exploration of diverse treatment modalities for depression, including pharmacological, neuromodulation (rTMS, tDCS), and behavioral interventions (meditation, cognitive training).
*   Research into specific populations (menopausal women, veterans, individuals with mTBI) and subtypes of depression (anhedonic, treatment-resistant).
*   Investigation of underlying mechanisms (circadian rhythms, cortical inhibition, neuroinflammation) and biomarkers for treatment response.
*   Focus on both efficacy and feasibility/tolerability of novel approaches.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This resource provides a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge research in depression treatment and diagnosis. The details on various clinical trials offer insights into emerging therapies, diagnostic approaches, and specific populations affected by depression. This information can be invaluable for the HelpMe app's RAG system, providing PhD-level data on the latest advancements in depression research, which can inform personalized treatment suggestions and psychoeducational content.




## Summary of the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Depression Across Three Age Cohorts (APA)

**Source:** Guideline Development Panel for the Treatment of Depressive Disorders. (2022). Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts. *American Psychologist*, 77(6), 770-780. [PubMed Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34843274/)

**Abstract:** This article summarizes the American Psychological Association (APA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depressive disorders, including major depression, subsyndromal depression, and persistent depressive disorder. The guideline provides recommendations for adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). It is based on ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses, along with other literature and observations from practitioners and patients. The panel, composed of health professionals from psychology, psychiatry, and family medicine, as well as community members with lived experience of depression, examined the efficacy of psychological treatments and complementary and alternative medicine treatments. It also compared the effectiveness of psychological treatments, alone and in combination with pharmacotherapy, and in relation to pharmacotherapy and complementary/alternative treatments. Recommendations for children were not made. The guideline targets clinicians, researchers, patients, family members, and policymakers.

**Key Findings:**
*   The APA guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for treating various depressive disorders across different age groups (adolescents, adults, older adults).
*   It considers psychological treatments, complementary/alternative medicine, and their effectiveness compared to or in combination with pharmacotherapy.
*   The guideline is based on a comprehensive review of scientific evidence and incorporates perspectives from practitioners and patients.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This guideline is a crucial resource for the 'Depression Treatment' domain of the HelpMe app. It provides PhD-level, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of depression, which can directly inform the app's content on treatment approaches, psychoeducation, and personalized game plans for users. The focus on different age cohorts is also valuable for tailoring information to the app's diverse user base.
