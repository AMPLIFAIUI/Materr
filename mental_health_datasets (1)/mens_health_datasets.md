**Abstract:** This article challenges common assumptions about men’s mental health, arguing that many researchers take for granted that men’s mental health can be explained in the same terms as women’s or measured using the same tools. While women tend to have higher rates of internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety), men experience more externalizing symptoms (violence, substance abuse). The authors suggest that measurement and clinician bias may lead to underestimations of depression and anxiety in men. They advocate for a focus on within-gender differences and a deeper understanding of men’s lived experiences and psychological well-being.

**Key Findings:**
*   Traditional approaches to men’s mental health may overlook internalizing disorders due to measurement and clinician bias.
*   Men often express distress through externalizing behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, violence).
*   There is a need for research that focuses specifically on men’s mental health experiences, rather than solely on gender comparisons.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This research is highly relevant to the ‘Men’s Health’ domain. It provides a critical perspective on how men’s mental health is understood and assessed, which is crucial for developing an app specifically for men. The insights into how men express distress differently and the potential for underdiagnosis of internalizing disorders can inform the app’s self-assessment tools, coping strategies, and educational content. It emphasizes the importance of a nuanced approach that acknowledges the unique challenges men face in seeking and receiving mental health support.
