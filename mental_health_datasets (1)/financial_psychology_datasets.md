**Abstract:** This study examines the association between financial worries and psychological distress among US adults, and how this relationship is moderated by factors like gender, marital status, employment status, education, and income levels. Using data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, the study found a significant association between higher financial worries and increased psychological distress. This association was more pronounced among unmarried individuals, the unemployed, lower-income households, and renters. The findings suggest a need for accessible financial counseling and public health interventions to mitigate the negative impact of financial worries on mental health, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations.

**Key Findings:**
*   Financial worries are significantly associated with higher psychological distress.
*   The impact of financial worries on mental health is exacerbated in vulnerable populations (e.g., unmarried, unemployed, lower-income, renters).
*   Highlights the importance of financial counseling and public health interventions to address financial stress and its mental health consequences.
