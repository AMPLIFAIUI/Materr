**Abstract:** This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of behavioral sleep-promoting interventions on sleep characteristics and psychological distress in adolescents and emerging adults (12-25 years) without a sleep disorder. It found that these interventions significantly increased total sleep time but had no significant effect on sleep efficiency. The review highlights the high prevalence of short sleep duration and psychological distress in this age group and emphasizes the need for more research on the impact of sleep interventions on psychological distress.

**Key Findings:**
*   Behavioral sleep interventions can increase total sleep time in adolescents and emerging adults.
*   Short sleep duration is a risk factor for psychological distress in this population.
*   More research is needed to determine the effect of sleep-promoting interventions on reducing psychological distress.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is highly relevant to the ‘Sleep Disorders’ domain, particularly as it relates to younger populations. It provides PhD-level evidence on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for improving sleep, which is crucial for mental health. For the HelpMe app, this information can inform the development of modules focused on sleep hygiene, behavioral sleep strategies, and the link between sleep and mental well-being. It can guide the app in offering evidence-based tools and advice to users struggling with sleep, especially adolescents and emerging adults, thereby contributing to better overall mental health outcomes. The emphasis on behavioral interventions aligns with the app's potential to provide actionable self-help strategies.
