**Abstract:** This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of late-life depression interventions on functional limitations. It identified 15 randomized controlled trials and categorized interventions into psychological, drug treatment, physical exercise, and collaborative care. The review found that multicomponent and collaborative-care interventions appear most promising for improving functional limitations, particularly in primary care and community-dwelling older adults with depressive symptoms. It highlights that functional recovery is an important treatment goal for older adults, often not fully addressed in studies focusing solely on symptomatic recovery.

**Key Findings:**
*   Depression in older adults significantly impacts health, well-being, and daily functioning.
*   Multicomponent and collaborative-care interventions show promise in improving functional limitations in late-life depression.
*   Functional recovery is a crucial outcome for older adults with depression, and more research is needed in specialized mental health care settings.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This systematic review is highly relevant to the ‘Aging / Geriatric Mental Health’ domain. It provides PhD-level insights into effective interventions for late-life depression, specifically focusing on functional outcomes, which are critical for older adults. For the HelpMe app, this information can inform the development of modules that address depression in older populations, emphasizing holistic approaches that consider both mental health symptoms and daily functioning. It can guide the app in providing resources that promote collaborative care, physical activity, and tailored psychological interventions for older users. The study’s focus on functional limitations can also inspire features within the app that help older adults track and improve their ability to engage in daily activities, thereby enhancing their overall quality of life.
