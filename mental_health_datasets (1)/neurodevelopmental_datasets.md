**Abstract:** This study profiled mental health symptoms in children with neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) like autism and ADHD who were attending a hospital-based diagnostic service. It found that a significant proportion of these children (over one-third) had mental health needs, with increased prevalence rates compared to the general population. Females reported increased internalizing symptoms, and children with multiple NDCs had greater needs. The study emphasizes the critical importance of identifying and addressing mental health concerns in children with NDCs early on, and ensuring service providers are equipped to offer appropriate resources and care pathways.

**Key Findings:**
*   Mental health concerns are highly prevalent in children with neurodevelopmental conditions.
*   These concerns are often unaddressed, leading to poorer outcomes.
*   Females with NDCs may experience more internalizing symptoms.
*   Children with multiple NDCs have higher mental health needs.
*   Early identification and integrated care are crucial.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This research is highly relevant to the ‘Neurodevelopmental (e.g., ADHD, ASD)’ domain. It provides PhD-level insights into the significant mental health comorbidities associated with neurodevelopmental conditions in children. For the HelpMe app, this information can inform the development of modules that address the unique mental health challenges faced by individuals with ADHD and ASD, including anxiety, depression, and behavioral difficulties. It highlights the importance of early intervention, comprehensive assessment, and integrated care pathways. The findings can help the app tailor content and resources to support both individuals with NDCs and their caregivers, promoting better mental health outcomes.
