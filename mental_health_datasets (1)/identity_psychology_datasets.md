**Abstract:** This study developed and validated a Doctoral Student Identity Scale, based on qualitative and quantitative analyses within the Chinese cultural context. The scale consists of two factors: identity exploration and identity commitment. The study found that doctoral student identity is significantly and positively correlated with subjective well-being, self-esteem, and psychological sense of school membership. The research highlights that doctoral student identity is an important factor influencing mental health, academic persistence, professional recognition, and academic investment.

**Key Findings:**
*   Doctoral student identity is a measurable construct with factors of exploration and commitment.
*   A strong doctoral student identity is positively correlated with mental well-being indicators like subjective well-being and self-esteem.
*   Identity development is crucial for academic success and mental health in specific academic contexts.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** While this study focuses on doctoral student identity, its methodology and findings on the link between identity and mental health are broadly applicable to the 'Psychology (identity, trauma, etc.)' domain. It provides a framework for understanding how identity formation and a sense of self can impact mental well-being. For the HelpMe app, this can inform modules that help users explore their identity, understand how their self-perception influences their mental health, and develop strategies for positive identity development, especially in the context of life transitions or challenging experiences. The emphasis on measurable constructs can also inspire ways to track progress in identity-related mental health goals within the app.
