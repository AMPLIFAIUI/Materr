**Abstract:** This systematic meta-review summarizes the findings and grades the quality of previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on eating disorder (ED) treatments. It covers various EDs (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder) across different age groups and settings. The review highlights that while psychological interventions are recommended as first-line treatments, their efficacy is modest, and relapse is common. It also notes inconsistencies among current guidelines and the need for more comprehensive research, particularly regarding the effectiveness of different treatment integration models and the impact of various factors on treatment outcomes.

**Key Findings:**
*   Psychological interventions are primary treatments for EDs, but their efficacy is modest, and relapse rates are high.
*   There is a need for more consistent and evidence-based guidelines for ED treatment.
*   Further research is required to understand the effectiveness of different treatment approaches and factors influencing outcomes.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** This meta-review is highly valuable for the ‘Eating Disorders’ domain. It provides a comprehensive, PhD-level overview of the current state of ED treatment research, including its strengths and limitations. This information can inform the app’s content on evidence-based treatment approaches, realistic expectations for recovery, and the importance of integrated care. It also highlights areas where the app can provide support for relapse prevention and ongoing management, acknowledging the complexities of ED recovery. The detailed analysis of various interventions can help in tailoring personalized recommendations within the app.
