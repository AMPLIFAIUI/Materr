**Abstract:** This systematic review assesses intervention literature focused on supporting and treating mental health within the healthcare workforce. It screened over 5000 publications and included 118 interventions. The study found that targeted, well-designed mental health interventions can significantly improve outcomes among healthcare workers, reducing stress, anxiety, emotional exhaustion, burnout, and depression. The review highlights the critical need for mental health support in this vulnerable workforce, especially given the economic burden of mental health issues in the workplace.

**Key Findings:**
*   Targeted mental health interventions are effective in improving mental health outcomes (reducing stress, anxiety, burnout, depression) among healthcare workers.
*   The economic burden of mental health issues in the workplace is substantial.
*   The review provides a comprehensive overview of evidence-based interventions for mental health in healthcare settings.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** While this review focuses on healthcare workers, the identified evidence-based interventions and the systematic approach to evaluating mental health support are highly relevant to the 'Crisis Intervention' domain of the HelpMe app. The findings can inform the development of effective crisis intervention strategies and resources within the app, particularly those related to stress, anxiety, and burnout, which are common in various high-pressure situations. The methodology of the systematic review itself can also serve as a model for how the app's knowledge base is structured and updated with PhD-level research.




## Crisis Interventions in Schools: A Systematic Review

**Abstract:** This systematic review synthesizes research on school-based crisis intervention protocols, descriptions, and evaluations. It found a significant lack of evaluation studies, suggesting that interventions are often administered without proper assessment of their effectiveness. The PREPaRE model was the most frequently named crisis intervention model. The review highlights the need for more rigorous evaluation of crisis interventions to measure their fidelity, reliability, and effectiveness in promoting student well-being post-crisis.

**Key Findings:**
*   A critical gap exists in the evaluation of school-based crisis interventions.
*   The PREPaRE model is a commonly referenced crisis intervention framework.
*   More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of crisis interventions in schools.

**Relevance to HelpMe App:** While focused on schools, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the challenges and needs in the field of crisis intervention. For the HelpMe app, this emphasizes the importance of evidence-based approaches and the need for continuous evaluation of interventions. The findings can inform the app's approach to developing and presenting crisis intervention strategies, ensuring they are grounded in research and highlight areas where further research is needed. This also provides a model for how to approach the
